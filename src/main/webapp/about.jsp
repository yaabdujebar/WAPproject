        About Us:<br>
        Tibeb Habesha is a privately-owned company which has been in the business for over 5
        years.<br>
        At Tibeb Habesha, we believe every outfit is an opportunity to express
        yourself. Inspired by Eritrean and Ethiopian traditional style and informed by
        today’s modern design, we offer a curated wardrobe that lets you do just that!
        But our passion goes beyond great clothes. Since day one, we’ve championed
        values of female empowerment. We’re dedicated to serving our
        community of amazing women by celebrating their stories and offering a full
        range of sizes. Because everyone deserves to fit right in.<br>
        Every. Detail. Matters. When it comes to quality, our Technical Designers look at every
        trim, stitch and measurement to ensure the perfect fit. Meeting our quality and price
        standards means having a dedicated Production Team which works closely with our
        manufacturers.
